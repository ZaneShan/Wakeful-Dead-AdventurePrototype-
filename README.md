A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: 
    oproom
    hall
    security
    janitor
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: 
    intro
    outro
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - click(object, location) //eliminates pointdown on non conditional objects (unlocked doors, etc.)
    - describe(object, message); //eliminates pointerover on non conditional objects

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: unsatisfied (name at least 4 of the classes).
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)
